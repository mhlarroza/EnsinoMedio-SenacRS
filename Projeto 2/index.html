        <h1> Call Out My Name - The Weeknd </h1>
        <div>
        We found each other <br>
        I helped you out of a broken place <br>
        You gave me comfort <br>
        But falling for you was my mistake <br>
        <br>
        I put you on top, I put you on top <br>
        I claimed you so proud and openly <br>
        And when times were rough, when times were rough <br>
        I made sure I held you close to me <br>
        <br>
        So call out my name (call out my name) <br>
        Call out my name when I kiss you so gently <br>
        I want you to stay (I want you to stay) <br>
        I want you to stay even though you don't want me <br>
        Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?) <br>
        Girl, why can't you wait till I fall out of love? <br>
        Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name) <br>
        Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and <br>
        I'll be on my— <br>
        <br>
        I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied <br>
        I almost cut a piece of myself for your life <br>
        Guess I was just another pit stop <br>
        Till you made up your mind <br>
        You just wasted my time <br>
        <br>
        You're on top, I put you on top <br>
        I claimed you so proud and openly, babe <br>
        And when times were rough, when times were rough <br>
        I made sure I held you close to me <br>
        <br>
        So call out my name (call out my name, baby) <br>
        So call out my name when I kiss you so gently <br>
        I want you to stay (I want you to stay) <br>
        I want you to stay even though you don't want me <br>
        Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait till I—) <br>
        Girl, why can't you wait till I fall out of love? <br>
        Babe, call out my name (say you'll call out my name, baby) <br>
        Just call out my name, and I'll be on my way <br>
        Girl, I'll be on my— <br> </div>
